Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For project two, much of the setup for the project was provided to me. However, I wrote the code in the main loop of the application. This code was what allowed the agent to decide on the action strategy for the treasure hunt problem. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists study and apply computing principles to solve problems and develop technologies. They design software, create algorithms, analyze data, and develop technologies like artificial intelligence and networking systems. This work impacts industries such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. By tackling technical challenges and improving connectivity, computer scientists play an important role in shaping a more efficient and secure world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When I am approaching a problem, I start by thoroughly understanding and defining the problem, breaking it into smaller components, and identifying constraints. I would then research existing solutions and plan my approach to the problem by mocking up the solution through psuedocode or a chart. I would then implement the solution using best coding practices and then test and debug to ensure functionality. I would then evaluate the outcome and optimize it for performance and scalability, while documenting the process and results for future reference.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring privacy, security, and fairness in the programs that I create. I aim to avoid harm and foster inclusivity and accessiblity. I also prioritize user well-being and make sure my programs align with organizational goals while ensuring ethical considerations guide innovation and decision making.
